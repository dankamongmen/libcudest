    * Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort devices to occasionally fail to turn
      back on after the system is resumed from suspend.

    * Added a ModeValidation X configuration option token,
      "AllowNon3DVisionModes", to allow modes that are not optimized for
      NVIDIA 3D Vision to be validated on 3D Vision monitors.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GT 635M
        * GeForce 610M

      the use of the __GL_HEAP_ALLOC_LIMIT environment variable.  See the README
      for further details.

    * Added an "Accel" option to the X driver to allow disabling its use of the
      graphics processing hardware.  This is useful when other components, such
      as CUDA, require exclusive use of the GPU's processing cores.

    * Modified how the OpenGL driver allocates executable memory so it may
      continue to function properly if /tmp is mounted noexec. As some fallback
      allocation methods may be prohibited under SELinux policy, the driver now
      supports detection of this policy as well as manual override of this
      detection via the __GL_SELINUX_BOOLEANS environment variable.

    * Fixed a bug that caused various GLSL built-in uniforms to not
      be updated properly when calling glPopAttrib.

    * Improved performance by caching compiled OpenGL shaders to disk. Added a
      "GLShaderDiskCache" option to the X driver to enable/disable this
      feature. Added the __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE and __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH
      environment variables for further configuration. See the README for
      further details.

      or later.

    * Modified the X driver to request that hardware inform the audio driver
      whenever a display is disabled. This will allow the audio driver to
      generate the appropriate jack unplug events to applications.

    * Added support for the GL_EXT_x11_sync_object extension.  See the
      extension specification in the OpenGL registry here:

        http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/x11_sync_object.txt

      for more details.

    * Dropped support for xserver ABI 9 (which was only used with xorg-server
      1.10 RC2 due to a last-minute xserver change).

2011-02-24 version 270.29

    * Added official support for xorg-server 1.10 [RC2 only, see above].  The
      -ignoreABI option is no longer required with this version of the server.

2011-02-15 version 270.26

    * Added NV-CONTROL event notification for NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SYNC_READY
      status changes.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTX 560 Ti

      "display preemption" when rendering to tiny or zero-sized windows or
      pixmaps.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU which prevented use of the overlay presentation
      queue following an application exiting without gracefully destroying its
      VDPAU presentation queue.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that prevented the overlay from ever being used if
      a presentation queue was created while the target window was redirected
      using the Composite extension when the presentation queue was created.

2011-01-21 version 270.18

    * Added preliminary support for xserver 1.10.

    * Reorganized the NVIDIA driver's /proc file system layout to better
      reflect current needs: /proc/driver/nvidia/cards/0..N has been
      moved to /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/0..N/information

    * Added new shared library: libnvidia-ml.so.

      NVML provides programmatic access to static information and monitoring
      data for NVIDIA GPUs, as well as limited managment capabilities. It is 
      intended for use with Tesla compute products.

      See web-based documentation and associated nvml.h header for more info.

    * Added a new X configuration option "3DVisionDisplayType" to specify
      the display type when NVIDIA 3D Vision is enabled with a non
      3D Vision ready display.

    * Fixed several bugs relating to hardware-accelerated gradients, which were
      causing visual corruption in some of the default Ubuntu GNOME themes.

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_ARB_shader_subroutine
      GL_ARB_map_buffer_range                         

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX
      indirect rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_NV_half_float
      GL_NV_occlusion_query                             
      GL_EXT_blend_equation_separate                  
      GL_EXT_depth_bounds_test

======== Release 265 Entries ========

    * Modified colormap updates to no longer be synchronized to vblank.  This
      allows applications to send XStoreColor and XStoreColors requests faster
      than the screen's refresh rate.

      This behavior can be controlled by a new NV-CONTROL attribute,
      NV_CONTROL_SYNC_LUT_UPDATES.  By default, LUT updates are not
      synchronized.  This may cause flickering in some applications that use the
      colormap to perform animation, such as xpilot running on a depth 8 X
      screen.  If you experience flickering, try running

          nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/SynchronousPaletteUpdates=1

======== Release 260 Entries ========
    * Updated the NVIDIA X driver to not update mode timings for G-Sync
      compatibility when NVIDIA 3D Vision or NVIDIA 3D VisionPro is
      enabled along with a G-Sync device.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

	* Quadro 2000 D
	* Quadro 400

2011-01-21 version 260.19.36

    * Updated the NVIDIA kernel module to ensure that all system memory
      allocated by it for use with GPUs or within user-space components of the
      NVIDIA driver stack is initialized to zero.  A new NVIDIA kernel module
      option, InitializeSystemMemoryAllocations, allows administrators to
      revert to the previous behavior.

    * Fixed a bug that caused X servers version 1.9 and higher to crash when
      color index overlays were enabled.

    * Fixed a bug that caused pixel value 255 to be treated as transparent in
      color index overlays.

2010-12-13 version 260.19.29

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTX 460 SE
        * GeForce GTX 570

	* Quadro 5000M
	* NVS 300

    * Fixed a bug that caused some OpenGL applications to become
      unresponsive for up to a minute on some GPUs when changing
      the resolution or refresh rate.

    * Added support for NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro.
      See the "Stereo" X configuration documentation in the README
      for further details.

    * Added a new X configuration option "3DVisionProConfigFile"
      to allow user provide a filename which NVIDIA X driver uses
      to store 3D Vision Pro configuration settings.
      See "Appendix B. X Config Options" in the README for
      more information.

2010-11-11 version 260.19.21

      260.* driver series.

2010-10-13 version 260.19.12

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTS 450
        * GeForce GTX 460M
        * GeForce GT 415M
        * GeForce GT 425M
        * GeForce GT 420M
        * GeForce GT 435M

        * Quadro 2000
        * Quadro 600

    * Temporarily added back OpenGL header files to the Linux driver
      package, though these are not installed by default.  To have these
      OpenGL header files installed, pass "--opengl-headers" to the NVIDIA
      .run file.  These will be removed from future NVIDIA driver packages
      once http://www.opengl.org/registry/ provides gl.h and glx.h.

    * Fixed the CustomEDID X configuration option so that it can handle
      EDID files from Linux procfs; e.g., /proc/acpi/video/IGPU/LCD0/EDID.

2010-09-15 version 260.19.06

    * Fixed an interaction problem with a change in X server behavior that
      caused slow text rendering on X.Org xserver 1.9.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to support interop with CUDA and OpenGL when Xinerama
      is active.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that prevented temporal-spatial de-interlacing from
      operating when temporal de-interlacing was not also enabled.

    * Added support for configuring the dithering depth used when driving
      a flat panel with a GeForce 8 family or Quadro 4600/5600 or
      newer GPU.  See the "Dithering Controls" in the Flat Panel page
      in nvidia-settings.

2010-09-08 version 260.19.04

    * Added support for the nvcuvid API.

      nvcuvid provides a mechanism for decoding video and exposing the
      surfaces to CUDA, allowing applications to perform custom processing of
      the video. nvcuvid is primarily targeted at transcoding and video-
      processing applications. nvcuvid was already available on other
      platforms.

      By default, nvidia-installer places the nvcuvid library in
      /usr/lib/libnvcuvid.so, or in the appropriate library path for
      your system.  The nvcuvid header files can be retrieved from the
      CUDA toolkit package.

    * Stopped packaging and installing OpenGL, VDPAU, CUDA, and OpenCL
      header files with the driver.  Those interested in these files can
      get them from their Linux distributions' packages, where available,
      or upstream from:

        OpenGL header files (gl.h, glext.h glx.h, glxext.h):
            http://www.opengl.org/registry/

        VDPAU header files (vdpau.h and vdpau_x11.h):
            http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/VDPAU

        CUDA and OpenCL header files (cuda.h, cudaGL.h, cudaVDPAU.h,
                cl.h, cl_gl.h, cl_platform.h):
            http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpucomputing.html

      Note that while libvdpau.so is still included in 260.xx drivers,
      it will be removed from a future release series in early 2011.
      Distributors are encouraged to package libvdpau.so from
      http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/VDPAU

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause a "display preemption" when
      toggling MPlayer to full-screen the first time.

    * Added OpenGL 4.1 support for Quadro Fermi, GeForce GTX 4xx, and
      later GPUs.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to fully support Xinerama.

    * Fixed a bug in the X driver that prevented operation of Xinerama when
      using multiple NVIDIA GPUs from different major hardware generations
      on X with ABI 4 or greater.

    * Fixed a bug in the OpenGL driver's Xinerama support.

      Rendering should have ocurred to all physical X screens driven by an
      NVIDIA GPU compatible with the NVIDIA GPU driving physical X screen 0.
      However, if some physical X screen did not satisfy that requirement,
      then not only would that physical X screen not be rendered to (as
      expected), but also all physical X screens with a higher number would
      not be rendered to (which was unexpected).

    * Added GPU "Processor Clock" reporting to the nvidia-settings PowerMizer
      page.

    * Implemented support for SLI Mosaic Mode on Quadro FX 5800 and
      Quadro Fermi and newer Quadro GPUs.

    * Enhanced the VDPAU overlay-based presentation queue to allow it to be
      used when SLI is active, and in some cases when the X composite
      extension is enabled. See the README for further details.

    * Added support for configuring the dithering mode used when driving
      a flat panel with a GeForce 8 family or Quadro 4600/5600 or
      newer GPU.  See the "Dithering Controls" in the Flat Panel page
      in nvidia-settings.

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_EXT_texture_integer
      GL_ARB_stencil_two_side
      GL_EXT_transform_feedback2
      GL_NV_transform_feedback2
      GL_NV_conditional_render

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect rendering)
      for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_NV_point_sprite
      GL_EXT_stencil_two_side
      GL_EXT_point_parameters
      GL_ARB_transpose_matrix
      GL_EXT_framebuffer_blit
      GL_EXT_framebuffer_multisample

    * GLX protocol for the following OpenGL extension is promoted
      from unofficial GLX ptotocol to ARB approved GLX protocol:
      GL_EXT_geometry_shader4
      GL_ARB_shader_objects
      GL_ARB_vertex_shader
      GL_ARB_fragment_shader

    * Added support for configuring individual displays as any eye in passive
      stereo mode "4" when using TwinView or SLI Mosaic through extensions to
      the MetaMode syntax.

    * Added ColorSpace and ColorRange features for HDMI. These give
      the ability to output YUV over HDMI and select full/reduced
      color range on RGB over HDMI. ColorSpace and ColorRange
      are X Configuration options and can be changed dynamically
      through nvidia-settings.

======== Release 256 Entries ========

    * Fixed a bug that prevented XvMC from initializing in most cases.

    * Added support for xorg-server video driver ABI version 8, which will be
      included in the upcoming xorg-server-1.9 series of releases.

    * Fixed a bug that caused extremely slow rendering of OpenGL applications
      on X screens other than screen 0 when using a compositing manager.

    * Fixed a regression introduced after 256.35 that caused stability
      problems on GPUs such as GeForce GT 240.

    * Fixed a slow kernel virtual address space leak observed when
      starting and stopping OpenGL, CUDA, or VDPAU applications.

    * Fixed a bug that left the system susceptible to hangs when running
      two or more VDPAU applications simultaneously.

2010-07-29 version 256.44

    * Added Support for Quadro 4000, Quadro 5000, and Quadro 6000.

    * Updated nvidia-installer to detect the nouveau kernel module and
      fail with an appropriate error message.

    * Added information to the NVIDIA driver README on how to disable
      the nouveau driver.

    * Fixed VDPAU to not print a debug error message when calling
      VdpVideoMixerQueryFeatureSupport with an unsupported or unknown
      VdpVideoMixerFeature.

    * Removed the requirement that in TwinView passive stereo, MetaModes
      must have identical viewports on each monitor.

    * Removed the requirement that in active stereo, all monitors must
      use identical modetimings.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to better report certain kinds of initialization error.

    * Fixed a regression that caused Xv to return BadAlloc errors on AGP
      systems when using the AGP GART driver contained in the NVIDIA driver.
      This fixes the problem reported in nvnews.net thread 151199.

2010-06-22 version 256.35

    * Fixed a regression in 256.29 where Performance Level clock
      frequencies were reported incorrectly in nvidia-settings.

    * Fixed a 3D Vision Stereo bug that caused the stereo glasses to not
      toggle when the flat panel was not running at its native mode timings.

    * Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to crash when rendering
      its thermal gauge widget if the range of valid values for the thermal
      sensor was empty.

2010-05-28 version 256.29

    * Fixed a bug which prevented use of high performance PowerMizer
      levels on systems with certain ACPI configurations.

    * Fixed a bug that caused non-primary Fermi GPUs to fail to initialize
      framebuffer memory. This caused a variety of symptoms, up to and
      including system hangs.

2010-05-21 version 256.25

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:

       GL_ARB_blend_func_extended
       GL_ARB_draw_buffers_blend
       GL_ARB_sample_shading
       GL_ARB_timer_query
       GL_EXT_draw_buffers2
       GL_EXT_separate_shader_objects
       GL_NV_explicit_multisample
       GL_NV_transform_feedback

    * Improved Thermal Settings reporting in nvidia-settings to
      accurately reflect hardware configurations with multiple thermal
      sensors.

    * Fixed an interaction problem between Compiz and
      'screen-scraping' VNC servers like x11vnc and vino that caused the screen
      to stop updating.
      Fixes Launchpad bug #353126.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to add basic support for Xinerama. VDPAU will now
      operate on a single physical X screen under Xinerama. See the
      README for more details.

    * Enhanced VDPAU's handling of corrupt clips of all formats on GPUs with
      VDPAU feature set C to be at least as good as on GPUs with VDPAU
      feature set B. This significantly improves various clips provided by
      nvnews.net user eamiller.

    * Fixed a bug in Xv attribute handling that caused hue, saturation,
      brightness, and contrast values to be misapplied when using an
      Xv overlay adaptor.

    * Fixed a bug in the XvMC driver that prevented it from working on
      systems with AGP graphics cards.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to clear all VdpVideoSurfaces to black when allocated.
      This provides more consistent results when using a surface as a
      reference when no prior decode operation has written to that surface.
      In turn, this improves the results of decoding some corrupt streams,
      such as "p_only_no_play" from ffmpeg bug 1124.

    * Implemented new APIs to allow sharing VDPAU surfaces with OpenGL and
      CUDA. The OpenGL extension is GL_NV_vdpau_interop. For CUDA, please
      see the documentation in the CUDA toolkit for details.

    * Worked around a bug where the combination of a GPU with VDPAU feature
      set A together with specific motherboard chipsets could cause visible
      corruption when decoding some MPEG-2 streams

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the VDPAU overlay-based presentation queue
      from being used more than a few hundred times per X server invocation.

    * Renamed the driver file libGLcore.so.VERSION to
      libnvidia-glcore.so.VERSION, as a small step towards reducing the
      filename collisions between NVIDIA's and Mesa's OpenGL implementations.
      This driver file is used by NVIDIA's libGL.so and libglx.so, and
      should never be used directly by applications.

    * Changed the SONAME of libnvidia-glcore.so.VERSION,
      libnvidia-tls.so.VERSION, and libnvidia-compiler.so.VERSION to be
      ".so.VERSION", rather than ".so.1".  These driver files are only used
      by other NVIDIA driver components, and are only intended to be used
      by components of the matching NVIDIA driver version.

    * Removed the "-pkg#" suffix from the NVIDIA Linux .run files.
      The packages are now simply named "NVIDIA-Linux-ARCH-VERSION.run".  On
      Linux-x86_64, a package which omits the 32-bit compatibility libraries
      is also available: "NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-VERSION-no-compat32.run"

    * Simplified the directory structure of the Linux extracted package;
      most driver files are now just contained within the top level directory
      of the package.  Pass the '--list' option to the .run file for details.

    * Removed precompiled kernel interfaces from the NVIDIA Linux-x86 .run
      file; these were ancient and had not been updated in years.  Going
      forward, NVIDIA does not plan to provide precompiled kernel interfaces
      with the Linux .run files.  However, nvidia-installer and the .run
      file will retain the ability for users to add their own precompiled
      kernel interfaces via the '--add-this-kernel' .run file option.

    * Compressed the nvidia-settings, nvidia-installer, and nvidia-xconfig 
      tarballs with bzip2, rather than gzip.

======== Release 195 Entries ========

    * Fixed a problem with SLI SFR, AFR, and SLIAA modes with GeForce GTX 480
      and GeForce GTX 470 and high-resolution display modes.

2010-04-28 version 195.36.24

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * GeForce GTX 480
        * GeForce GTX 470
        * Tesla C2050

    * Fixed a problem that caused occasional red flashes in XVideo frames.

    * Added official support for xserver 1.8.  The -ignoreABI option
      is no longer required with this version of the server.

    * Updated the "Supported NVIDIA GPU Products" list to include various
      supported GPUs that were missing previously.

2010-03-15 version 195.36.15

    * Fixed a regression that caused the driver to fail to properly adjust
      the GPU fan speed on some GPUs.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented performance level transitions on recent
      GPUs with SDDR3 and GDDR5 memory.

    * Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash when rendering
      occurred while the X server was not on the active VT.

2010-03-03 version 195.36.08

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        * Quadro FX 880M
        * GeForce GTS 350M
        * GeForce GTS 360M

    * Fixed a bug that caused screen corruption after an application
      released a GLX_NV_present_video device.

    * Fixed an X server crash caused by starting nvidia-settings while X was not
      on the active VT.

    * Fixed brightness control hotkeys on some laptops.

    * Fixed an nvidia-settings bug that produced many "Bad argument" warning
      messages when running nvidia-settings --query all.

    * Fixed an installer bug that produced the following message:

        WARNING: Unable to perform the runtime configuration check for library
        'libGL.so.1' ('/usr/lib/libGL.so.195.36.03'); assuming successful
        installation.

    * Fixed a bug that caused G-Sync stereo synchronization to fail sometimes
      when enabling frame lock.

    * Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications to occasionally crash with
      "double free or corruption" messages when exiting.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU feature set A, enhanced VDPAU's handling of some
      corrupted or incorrectly formatted MPEG-1/2 streams. This solves a
      reported issue with "0testbad.mpg".

    * Fixed a bug in the VDPAU video mixer that caused chroma aberrations,
      and corruption in the right-hand few columns of pixels, when post-
      processing video surfaces with widths not an exact multiple of 4 pixels.

    * Fixed a bug that prevented the GPUFanControlState attribute from
      being set on the nvidia-settings command line.

2010-02-03 version 195.36.03

    * Fixed a regression that made the "TVStandard" X configuration option
      cause system hangs with products from the GeForce 6 and 7 series.

    * Worked around a bug in some AUO laptop flat panels where the native mode
      in the EDID is invalid, leading to a 640x480 desktop repeated six times
      across the screen.

    * Increased the maximum number of slices supported by VDPAU for MPEG-2
      streams, in order to cope with the region 1 DVD "A Christmas Story".

    * Added unofficial preliminary support for xorg-server video driver ABI
      version 7, including xorg-server-1.7.99.2.

    * Fix the soname of libvdpau_nvidia.so.1 and libvdpau_trace.so.1 to
      match their filenames.

2009-12-22 version 195.30

    * Fixed a performance regression with non-antialiased text in KDE4.

    * Enabled GPU acceleration for many RENDER compositing operations that were
      previously processed in software, including conjoint and disjoint blending
      modes and component alpha blending.

    * Added experimental GPU acceleration of the RENDER CompositeTrapezoids
      operation. This can be enabled at runtime by running:

        nvidia-settings -a AccelerateTrapezoids=1

      This is only supported on the GeForce GTX series or newer products.

    * Fixed a bug in the VDPAU overlay-based presentation queue that caused
      high CPU usage during "put bits" operations when more than two surfaces
      were queued.

    * Updated `nvidia-settings --query all` to report all available
      attributes queryable through all NV-CONTROL target types.

2009-11-23 version 195.22

    * Enhanced the VDPAU blit-based presentation queue to provide values of
      "first_presentation_time" that have less jitter.

    * Add support for R16F and RG32F GLXFBConfigs when using GeForce 8
      series and higher GPUs.

    * Added support for NVIDIA 3D Vision Stereo on Linux with Quadro
      GPUs. See the "Stereo" X configuration documentation in the README
      for details.

    * Added support for A2BGR10 32-bit GLX visuals on 30-bit X screens.
      These allow some level of window transparency when using 30-bit
      visuals with GLX and Composite, but they may cause problems with
      older X servers and/or applications.  ARGB GLX visuals can be
      disabled by adding:

        Option "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "False"

      to the X configuration file.

    * Fixed a problem that caused DisplayPort devices to behave incorrectly when
      DPMS power saving mode was triggered.

    * Updated VDPAU to improve thread concurrency.  See the README for
      details.

    * Altered NVIDIA X driver behavior in the case that no display
      devices are connected to the GPU.  Previously, in this case,
      the NVIDIA X driver would pretend a CRT was connected to the GPU.
      Now, the NVIDIA X driver will not automatically pretend that
      any CRTs are connected.  If the X driver does not detect any
      connected display devices, the X server will fail to start.

      To restore the old behavior, use the ConnectedMonitor X
      configuration option; e.g.,

        Option "ConnectedMonitor" "CRT"

      Alternatively, if display is not desired, Quadro and Tesla GPU
      users can enable "NoScanout" mode, which bypasses any mode timing
      validation or use of display devices; this is configured with:

        Option "UseDisplayDevice" "none"

    * Disabled software cursors when the driver is operating in "no scanout"
      (UseDisplayDevice "none") mode.  The software cursor image is not visible
      in remote desktop applications or screenshots anyway, so having software
      cursor enabled was unnecessary.

    * Changed glXSwapBuffers() behavior for a pixmap such that it is now a no-op
      in the direct rendering case in order to match the indirect case and
      comply with the GLX spec. Previously, calling glXSwapBuffers() on pixmaps
      in the direct case would swap the pixmap's buffers if the pixmap was
      double buffered.

    * Modified the installation location and names of internal VDPAU libraries
      to conform to conventions and Debian packaging guidelines. New versions
      of libvdpau expect this layout. Compatibility with old versions of
      libvdpau is maintained with symlinks.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause errors in graphical applications run after a
      previous application using VDPAU and OpenGL. This behaviour was observed
      when running Gwenole Beauchesne's hwdecode-demos application.

    * Modified vdpau.h to increment VDPAU_VERSION, to reflect the fact that
      new features have been added in the past. Also, add the new define
      VDPAU_INTERFACE_VERSION.

    * Fixed a periodic temporary hang in the VDPAU blit-based presentation
      queue.

    * Fixed a problem that caused resolution limitations or corruption on
      certain DisplayPort devices such as the Apple 24" Cinema display or some
      DisplayPort to VGA adapters.

    * Disabled the UseEvents option for GeForce 8 series and higher GPUs due to
      a problem that causes occasional short hangs.  It will be re-enabled when
      that bug has been tracked down and fixed.

    * VDPAU now allows multiple streams to be decoded at once, without the
      need to set any environment variables.

======== Older Releases ========

2009-10-21 version 190.42

    * Fixed a bug in the nvidia-settings disclaimer window for the GPU
      Clock Frequencies Coolbits page, such that the "Accept" button is
      selectable when the desktop is so tall that the entire disclaimer
      can be viewed without scrolling.

    * Fixed a recent regression that caused the Xinerama option to not be set
      properly in the X configuration file when saving and merging from the
      nvidia-settings X Server Display Configuration page.

    * Fixed a resource leak in VDPAU's blit-based presentation queue.
      This bug limited the number of presentation queue objects that could be
      created and destroyed in a single application instance, and hence could
      limit the number of streams that could be displayed and/or the number
      of iterations of "loop" playback.

    * Fixed a power management regression that prevented some notebooks
      and systems with integrated GeForce 8 and 9 series GPUs from
      suspending.

    * Fixed a regression that caused TV-OUT controls to be unavailable on
      some GeForce 6 and 7 series GPUs.

2009-10-16 version 190.40

    * Added support for OpenGL 3.2.

    * Added support for NVIDIA Quadro SDI Capture, part of the Quadro
      Digital Video Pipeline.

    * Added support for the following GPUs:

        GeForce G102M 
        GeForce GT 220 
        GeForce G210 
        GeForce G210M 
        GeForce GT 230M 
        GeForce GT 240M 
        GeForce GTS 250M 
        GeForce GTS 260M 

    * Updated the NVIDIA X driver to allow, on GeForce 8 or greater GPUs,
      more modes to validate on digital display devices whose EDIDs
      report very constrained HorizSync or VertRefresh ranges.

    * Fixed a randomly occurring X server crash caused by the PixmapCache
      option.

    * Increased the allowed amount of overscan compensation from 100 to 200.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU feature set B, VDPAU's handling of some corrupted
      or incorrectly formatted H.264 and MPEG streams has been improved.

    * Fixed a memory allocation problem with pre-GeForce 8
      GPUs that caused GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap clients (e.g., Compiz,
      KDE 4) to display incorrect contents.

2009-09-24 version 190.36

    * Added support for X.Org xserver 1.6.99.901 (also known as 1.7.0 RC1).

    * Add a new OverscanCompensation NV-CONTROL attribute, available on GeForce
      8 and higher.  This option specifies the amount of overscan compensation
      to apply to the current mode.  It is measured in raster pixels, i.e.
      pixels as specified in the current mode's backend timings.

    * Updated nvidia-installer to detect newer Debian distributions that use
      /usr/lib32 instead of /emul/ia32-linux as the 32-bit library path.

    * Added GLX support for OpenGL 3.2 context profiles through the extension
      GLX_ARB_create_context_profile.

2009-09-04 version 190.32

    * Added support for IgnoreEDIDChecksum X configuration option, which can be
      used to force the X driver to accept the EDID of a display device even
      when the checksum is invalid. Please see the README IgnoreEDIDChecksum
      description for a caution and details of use.
    
    * Added support for configuring the GPU's fan speed; see the
      "Coolbits" X configuration option in the README.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause visible corruption near the bottom
      edge of the picture when decoding VC-1 simple/main profile clips whose
      heights are not exact multiples of 16 pixels, on GPUs with VDPAU feature
      set A.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU feature set C, VDPAU now supports decoding MPEG-4
      Part 2, DivX 4, and DivX 5 video. The VDPAU API has been enhanced to
      expose this feature.

    * On GPUs with VDPAU feature set C, VDPAU now supports a higher quality
      video scaling algorithm. The VDPAU API has been enhanced to expose this
      feature.

2009-08-21 version 190.25

    * Added code to reject screen modes based on available DisplayPort link
      bandwidth.  Fixes display corruption caused by allowing high bandwidth
      modes on display devices that can't handle them, such as certain
      DisplayPort-to-VGA adapters that only support 2 DisplayPort lanes.

    * Fixed an initialization problem on some mobile GPUs.

    * Worked around X.Org X server Bugzilla bug #22804.  This bug
      allows X clients to send invalid XGetImage requests to the
      hardware, leading to screen corruption or hangs.  This was most
      commonly triggered by running JDownloader in KDE 4.

    * Fixed a crash in nvidia-settings displaying GPU information when in Xinerama.

2009-07-23 version 190.18

    * Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect rendering)
      for the following OpenGL extensions:

        GL_ARB_draw_buffers
        GL_EXT_Cg_shader
        GL_EXT_gpu_program_parameters
        GL_NV_fragment_program
        GL_NV_gpu_program4
        GL_NV_register_combiners
        GL_NV_vertex_program1_1
        GL_NV_vertex_program2

    * Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:

        GL_ARB_geometry_shader4
        GL_ARB_shader_objects
        GL_ARB_texture_buffer_object
        GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object
        GL_ARB_vertex_shader
        GL_EXT_bindable_uniform
        GL_EXT_compiled_vertex_array
        GL_EXT_geometry_shader4
        GL_EXT_gpu_shader4
        GL_EXT_texture_buffer_object
        GL_NV_geometry_program4
        GL_NV_vertex_program
        GL_NV_parameter_buffer_object
        GL_NV_vertex_program4

      GLX protocol for GL_EXT_vertex_array was also updated to incorporate
      rendering using GL_ARB_vertex_buffer_object.
      Use of these extensions with GLX indirect rendering requires
      the AllowUnofficialGLXProtocol X configuration option and the
      __GL_ALLOW_UNOFFICIAL_PROTOCOL environment variable.

    * Fixed glXQueryVersion to report GLX version 1.4.  NVIDIA's GLX
      version has been 1.4 for several releases, and was already reported
      as 1.4 in the GLX client and GLX server version strings.

    * Fixed a problem that caused window border corruption when the screen is
      rotated.

    * Added support for configuring the GPU PowerMizer Mode on
      GeForce 8 or later GPUs with multiple performance levels via
      nvidia-settings and NV-CONTROL.

2009-08-21 version 185.18.36

    * Fixed a bug that caused kernel panics when starting X on some
      mobile GPUs.

    * Fixed an interaction problem between VDPAU and PowerMizer when using
      VDPAU solely as a display mechanism, and not to decode video streams.
      The GPU performance level should now be raised, if required, in this
      scenario.

    * Fixed VDPAU to avoid "display preemption" in some cases where a
      VdpOutputSurface is deleted while it is still active (either queued or
      visible) in a VdpPresentationQueue. In particular, this can occur in
      MPlayer when using the "-fs" option, and could completely prevent
      VDPAU from operating successfully, depending on the exact timing
      conditions.

2009-07-31 version 185.18.31

    *  Fixed a crash on certain mobile GPUs.

2009-07-28 version 185.18.29

    * Fixed a bug that could cause occasional memory corruption problems or
      segmentation faults when running OpenGL applications on Quadro GPUs.

    * Fixed a deadlock in the OpenGL library that could be triggered in certain
      rare circumstances on Quadro GPUs.

    * Fixed the order of outputs in the GPUScaling nvidia-settings property.

    * Fixed a bug that caused graphics corruption in some OpenGL applications
      when the Unified Back Buffer is enabled the application window is moved.

    * Fixed a bug that caused glXGetVideoSyncSGI, glXWaitVideoSyncSGI, and
      glXGetRefreshRateSGI to operate on the wrong screen when there are
      multiple X screens.

    * Fixed a bug that causes corruption or GPU errors when an application
      paints a redirected window whose background is set to ParentRelative on
      X.Org servers older than 1.5.

      This was typically triggered by running Kopete while using Compiz or
      Beryl.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause visible corruption when decoding
      H.264 clips with alternating frame/field coded reference pictures, and
      a video surface is concurrently removed from the DPB, and re-used as
      the decode target, in a single decode operation. This affected all GPUs
      supported by VDPAU.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause visible corruption near the bottom
      edge of the picture when decoding VC-1 advanced profile clips whose
      heights are not exact multiples of 16 pixels, on G98 and MCP7x (IGP)
      GPUs.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to better handle corrupt/invalid H.264 bitstreams on
      G84, G86, G92, G94, G96, or GT200 GPUs. This should prevent most cases
      of "display preemption" that are caused by bitstream errors.

    * Fixed an X server crash when using the VDPAU overlay-based presentation
      queue and VT-switching away from the X server.

    * Enhanced VDPAU's detection of the GPU's video decode capabilities.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause ghosting/flashing issues when
      decoding H.264 clips, in certain full DPB scenarios, on G98 and MCP7x.

    * Fixed VDPAU to detect an attempt to destroy the VdpDevice object when
      other device-owned objects still exist. VDPAU now triggers "display
      preemption", and returns an error, when this occurs.

    * Enhanced VDPAU's error handling and resource management in presentation
      queue creation and operation. This change correctly propagates all
      errors back to the client application, and avoids some resource leaks.

   Linux specific changes:

    * Added code to forcibly terminate long-running CUDA kernels when
      Ctrl-C is pressed.

    * Fixed an interaction problem between PowerMizer and CUDA applications that
      caused the performance level to be reduced while the CUDA kernel is
      running.

    * Made CUDA compute-exclusive mode persistent across GPU resets.

   FreeBSD specific changes:

    * Fixed an installer problem that prevented Linux ABI compatibility from
      working with newer versions of FreeBSD.

2009-05-27 version 185.18.14

    * Fixed a Xinerama drawable resource management problem that can cause
      GLXBadDrawable errors in certain cases, such as when Wine applications are
      run.

    * Fixed XineramaQueryScreens to return 0 screens instead of 1 screen with
      the geometry of screen 0 when XineramaIsActive returns false.  This
      conforms to the Xinerama manual page and fixes an interaction problem with
      Compiz when there is more than one X screen.

    * Add support for the UseEvents X configuration option on GeForce 8 and
      higher GPUs.

    * Moved kernel module loading earlier in the X driver's initialization,
      to facilitate more graceful fallbacks if the kernel module cannot
      be loaded.  Removed the LoadKernelModule X configuration option.

    * Added support for new horizontal interlaced and checkerboard passive
      stereo modes.

    * Fixed an OpenGL driver crash while running Bibble 5.

    * Fixed a DisplayPort interaction problem with power management
      suspend/resume events.

    * Fixed occasional X driver memory management performance problems
      when a composite manager is running.

    * Fixed a bug with VT-switching or mode-switching while using Compiz;
      the bug could lead to a corrupted desktop (e.g., a white screen)
      or in the worst case an X server crash.

    * Fixed a bug that could cause GPU errors in some cases while driving
      Quadro SDI products.

    * Fixed a several second hang when VT-switching while OpenGL stereo
      applications were running on pre-G80 Quadro GPUs.

    * Added support for multiple swap group members on G80 and later
      Quadro GPUs.

    * Fixed the behavior of the NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SYNC_DELAY NV-CONTROL
      attribute on Quadro G-Sync II.
    
    * Fixed a problem with Quadro SDI where transitioning from "clone
      mode" to "OpenGL mode" would fail.

    * Fixed VDPAU to eliminate some cases of corruption when decoding H.264
      video containing field-coded reference frames on G84, G86, G92, G94,
      G96, or GT200 GPUs. Such streams are commonly found in DVB broadcasts.

    * Slightly improved the performance of the VDPAU noise reduction
      algorithm.

    * Enhanced VDPAU to validate whether overlay usage is supported by the
      current hardware configuration, and to automatically fall back to the
      blit-based presentation queue if required.

    * Fixed error checking in VdpVideoMixerRender, to reject calls that
      specify more layers than the VdpMixer was created with.

    * Modified VDPAU's VDPAU_DEBUG code to emit a complete backtrace on all
      platforms, not just on 32-bit Linux.

    * Improved interaction between VDPAU and PowerMizer; appropriate
      performance levels should now be chosen for video playback of all
      standard resolutions on all supported GPUs.

    * Fixed a bug in VDPAU that sometimes caused "display preemption" when the
      VdpDecoderCreate function failed.

    * Fixed a potential segfault in the VDPAU trace library, triggered by
      a multi-threaded application creating a new VdpDevice in one thread,
      at the same time that another thread detected "display preemption".

  Linux specific changes:

    * Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.

  FreeBSD specific changes:

    * Modified VDPAU to dlopen libpthread.so (on all platforms), to avoid
      conflicts between the current libc and a compat libpthread.

2009-04-06 version 185.19

    * Added support for the following new GPUs:

        Quadro FX 3800
        Quadro FX 1800
        Quadro FX 380
        Quadro FX 580
        GeForce GTS 250
        GeForce GT 140
        GeForce GT 130
        GeForce 9600 GSO 512

    * Fixed SDI presentation time queries returning unexpected values.

    * Removed the 'AllowDFPStereo' X config file option, which is now enabled by
      default.

    * Fixed a bug that caused certain programs to hang when multiple threads
      call functions in libdl at the same time.

    * Fixed a driver crash when OpenGL applications use an extremely large
      number of textures.

    * Fixed GPU errors triggered by text rendering to PseudoColor windows with
      the glyph cache enabled.

    * Updated the X driver to allow pixmaps smaller than 32x32 pixels to be
      placed in video memory.

    * Fixed a problem that prevented the driver from retraining a DisplayPort
      link after a device was hotplugged.

    * Updated nvidia-bug-report.sh to automatically gzip the resulting log file.

    * Fixed VDPAU to eliminate some cases of GPU hangs when decoding H.264
      video on G84, G86, G92, G94, G96, or GT200 GPUs, and supplying a DPB
      missing some reference frames.

    * The VDPAU presentation queue now syncs to VBLANK in the blit
      path. The environment variable VDPAU_NVIDIA_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE
      selects which display to sync to when TwinView is enabled;
      see the README for details.

    * On systems using integrated graphics, VDPAU now uses system RAM
      instead of video RAM for many purposes. This should prevent "out
      of resources" problems in most cases, even when the video RAM
      carve-out is configured as low as 128M.

    * Added support for Quad-Buffered Stereo in the main plane
      simultaneously with the Color Index Overlay; i.e., both Stereo
      GLX FBConfigs and Color Index Overlay FBConfigs can be advertised
      and used at the same time, though no single GLX FBConfig contains
      both Stereo and Overlay capabilities.

2009-03-12 version 185.13

    * Numerous internal cleanups and improvements to OpenGL. In particular,
      GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap binding performance problems were resolved.

    * Fixed stability problems with some GeForce 6200/7200/7300 GPUs
      on multi-core/SMP systems.

    * Updated nvidia-bug-report.sh to compress its log file; running
      `nvidia-bug-report.sh` now produces "nvidia-bug-report.log.gz".

    * Addressed a problem that could lead to intermittent hangs
      and system crashes on some GeForce 9 and later GPUs.

    * Fixed an X server crash when viewing the website www.tim.it.

      flatpanel.

    * Fixed occasional X driver memory management performance problems 
      when a composite manager is running.

    * Fixed a bug that could interfere with the detection of display
      devices attached to secondary GPUs when first starting X
      after cold boots.

    * Fixed a problem that could result in temporary stalls when
      moving OpenGL application windows on GeForce 8 and
      later GPUs.

        Quadro NVS 295
        GeForce GT 120
        GeForce G100

    * Fixed a problem that could cause Xid errors and display corruption
      in certain cases when OpenGL is used to render to redirected windows,
      for example when Java2D is used with the -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true
      option.

    * Fixed a problem that caused the screen to flicker momentarily when
      OpenGL applications exit unexpectedly on GeForce 6 and 7 series GPUs.

    * Fixed an X server crash when an X client attempts to draw trapezoids
      and RenderAccel is disabled.

    * Improved recovery from certain types of errors.

    * Fixed a bug that caused Autodesk Maya to freeze when overlays
      are enabled.

    * Fixed an interaction problem between OpenGL and memory tracking

      by VDPAU; see the README for details.

    * Fixed VDPAU corruption on some H.264 clips.

    * Updated VDPAU documentation in the README and in vdpau.h,
      in particular regarding how to use the deinterlacing algorithms
      in the VdpVideoMixer object.  Explicitly documented "half rate"
      deinterlacing, which should allow the advanced algorithms to run
      on more low-end systems.

    * Implemented a "skip chroma deinterlace" option in VDPAU,
      which should allow the advanced deinterlacing algorithms to run
      on more low-end systems. See vdpau.h.

      corrupt/invalid MPEG streams on some GPUs.

    * Fixed VDPAU to correctly handle WMV "range reduction" on
      some GPUs. A minor backwards-compatible API change was made
      for this; see vdpau.h's documentation for structure field
      VdpPictureInfoVC1.rangered.

    * Fixed a problem that caused surfaces to be marked as visible
      too early when the blit presentation queue is in use.

    * Fixed VDPAU to prevent some cases of "display preemption"
      in the face of missing H.264 reference frames on some GPUs.

    * Fixed corruption decoding H.264 clips with pictures where
      pic_order_cnt_type implies log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4 is
      not used, on G84, G86, G92, G94, G96, GT200 GPUs.

      in its mode switch recovery code and a hang in the
      blit-based presentation queue.

    * Fixed a bug that caused VDPAU to crash when using DisplayPort
      devices.

    * Fixed a potential hang in VDPAU when using the blit-based
      presentation queue on systems with multiple GPUs not
      in SLI mode.

    * Implemented missing error checking of layer data in VDPAU's
      VdpVideoMixerRender function.

    * Improved VDPAU's handling of setups with multiple GPUs, if
      a subset of the GPUs cannot be supported due to
      resource limitations.

    * Improved GPU video memory management coordination between the
      NVIDIA X driver and VDPAU.

    * Fix potential hang in VDPAU when the overlay is already in use.

    * Improved workstation OpenGL performance.

    * Fixed an X driver acceleration bug that resulted in Xid errors
      on GeForce 6 and 7 series GPUs.

    * Updated the X driver to consider GPUs it does not recognize
      supported, allowing it to drive some GPUs it previously
      ignored.

    * Added the ability to run distribution provided pre- and post-
      installation hooks to 'nvidia-installer'; please see the
      'nvidia-installer' manual page for details.

    * Updated the X driver's metamode parser to allow mode names
      with periods (i.e. '.'s).

    * Fixed a problem in VDPAU that prevented the overlay-based
      presentation queue from being used on displays connected by component
      video.

    * Fixed various problems in VDPAU that caused visual corruption when
      decoding certain MPEG-2 video streams.

        Quadro NVS 150M

    * Improved support for RENDER masks, as well as RENDER repeating
      modes and transformations, for video memory pixmaps.

    * Added accelerated support for RENDER convolution filters for
      video memory pixmaps on GeForce 8, 9 and GTX GPUs.

    * Improved support for RENDER operations with the same source
      and destination; this should performance in some
      situations, e.g. when dragging Plasma applets in KDE4.

    * Improved GPU video memory management coordination between the
      NVIDIA X driver and OpenGL implementation; this should
      improve performance with e.g. the KDE4 OpenGL compositing
      manager.

    * Added an 'AllowSHMPixmaps' X configuration option, which can
      be used to prevent applications from using shared memory
      pixmaps; the latter may cause some optimizations in the NVIDIA
      X driver to be disabled.

    * Fixed a text rendering performance regression that affected
      GeForce 6 and 7 series GPUs.

    * Fixed a regression that caused the 'Auto' SLI X option
      setting to not enable SLI.

    * Fixed a bug that caused system hangs when using the NV-CONTROL
      interface to change GPU clock frequencies.

    * Added support for DisplayPort display devices (including

      3D engine to do Xv PutImage requests.  This allows XvMC to operate
      when the video overlay is not available (such as in TwinView).
      XvMC still uses the overlay by default, when available.  A new
      XF86Config option "XvmcUsesTextures" has been added to force
      usage of the 3D engine for XvMCPutSurface even when overlays are 
      available.

    * Added a shell script "nvidia-bug-report.sh" that gathers
      system configuration information into a log file; the resulting
      log file (nvidia-bug-report.log) should be included when reporting
      bugs to NVIDIA.

2004-1-26 version 1.0-5336

    * Added support for Linux 2.6 kernels.

    * Fixed a problem that caused kernels oops, black screens, and agp
      failures on some VIA motherboards.

    * Fixed a typo in the NVIDIA-provided libGL.la.

    * Fixed a problem that prevented X from running on Samsung X10 laptops.

    * Deprecated the "--kernel-include-path" .run commandline option,
      in favor of "--kernel-source-path".

2003-12-22 version 1.0-5328

    * Added support for UBB and FSAA Stereo.

    * Improved GLXPixamp support.

    * Added support for Red Hat Advanced Workstation 3.0.

    * Added support for GLX_SGI_swap_control.

    * Added an OS ABI ELF Note to the OpenGL libraries.

    * Fix a problem where the video overlay would sometimes stop working 
      when displaying HDTV resolutions.

    * For graphics cards that require a power connector but do not have
      a connector plugged in, fail X screen initialization, rather than
      just print a warning message.

    * Reduced CPU usage when OpenGL applications are syncing to vblank.

2003-7-28 version 1.0-4496

    * Improved OpenGL performance when rendering to multiple
      buffers (such as when using a stereo visual and rendering to
      GL_LEFT_AND_RIGHT).

    * Fixed a problem that prevented running multiple X servers on 
      different virtual terminals.

    * Improved IDCT level acceleration in XvMC.

    * Fixed a 2D performance slowdown experienced by many people.

    * Finished GLX 1.3 support

    * Support for AGP 3.0

    * Improved support for NForce2

    * Added support for NV30 and NV30 extensions.

    * Fixed bug where there was corruption at the borders of a pbuffer

    * More complete acceleration for the XRENDER extension.  Due to the
      experimental nature, RENDER acceleration is now disabled by default
      (Option "RenderAccel" enables it).

    * The driver no longer uses the XFree86 Acceleration Architecture (XAA),
      but provides its own 2D acceleration architecture to better accomodate
      the needs of simultaneous 3D and 2D rendering.

    * Added color index overlay emulation on Quadro4.

    * Added support for separate X screens on a single GPU (supported
      by all GPUs that support TwinView).

    * Fixed problem with loading the GLX extension in multi-head
      environments with non-NVIDIA video cards.

    * Significant performance improvements in Viewperf on Quadro parts.

    * Added option "NoRenderExtension" to disable the RENDER extension.
      This is useful in 8bpp where the RENDER extension will preallocate
      a large portion of the default colormap and break many legacy 
      applications.

    * Fixed a regression where I420 XvImages had the chroma planes swapped.

    * Fixed some problems with moving overlay windows.

    * Added a dynamic XvMC library "libXvMCNVIDIA_dynamic.so" so that 
      applications can dynamically load the vendor-specific core XvMC
      support.

    * Added XvMC motion-compensation acceleration for NV25 and fixed
      some bugs in the NV17 XvMC support.

    * Fixed some problems with FSAA modes failing.

      This allows mpeg acceleration on NV17 chips and NV17 chips only.

    * RGB Workstation overlays for Quadro4.  These are double buffered,
      Z-buffered 16 bit visuals.  The transparency key is 0x0000 hex.

    * NV17 and NV25 support.

    * Added an 8:8:8:8 XRGB XvImage format to the video blitter.

    * Config file option for Digital Vibrance Control.
     
    * Added new XF86Config option "FlatPanelProperties" to control dithering 
      and scaling when X is started.

    * Added support for SoftEDID's. When enabled the driver will generate 
      an EDID based on the video bios isntead of doing a table lookup.

    * Improved Crush support

    * Fixed problem with using SGIX_fbconfig and SGIX_pbuffer with 
      indirect rendering (protocol was incorrect)

    * Fixed problem where the driver would fail on systems with >= 1GB 
      of memory and a kernel configured to use all the memory.

2001-11-26 version 1.0-2313

    * Got Crush working.

    * OpenGL 1.3 support.

    * Added SGIX_pbuffer and SGIX_fbconfig extensions.

    * Added UBB support, pageflipping and window flipping (described in
      README).

      of immediate mode applications.

    * Improved stability on AMD platforms.

    * Fixed TwinView problem that caused garbage to appear on the screen
      when starting X with a null option on head 0.

    * Added workaround for XAA bug that causes system to hang when Lisa
      Screensaver is run.  The problem is worked around by adding the
      following line in the "Device" section of the XF86Config file:
      'Option "XaaNoSolidFillTrap"'.  This option prevents XAA from
      breaking wide lines (and polyggons) into trapezoids and avoids an
      XAA clipping bug.
      
    * Fixed a system hang that occured on some chipsets when taking the
      X server down (after having run once successfully) and restarting
      it while using the DVI-I connected toa flat panel.

    * Fixed problem where the performer application Perfly would hang
      when run in forked-draw mode.

    * Fixed problem where the X driver would segfault when given an
      invalid MetaMode.

    * Fixed problem where the console was not restored properly after
      entering X and returning to the console.

    * Fixed problem where X did not redraw completely after a screen
      blank on GForce 2 Go and Quadro 2 Go.

    * Fixed problem with initializing secondary card. In most cases, the
      secondary card is posted correctly.  In the cases where it isn't,
      there is now a workaround to initialize the card via X.

    * Added workarounds to enable AGP on ALI chipsets and enable 4X AGP
      on VIA chipsets (See README and use with caution!).

2001-08-20 version 1.0-1541

    * Changed behaviour of the X server so the NVIDIA splash screen will
      only show up on the first run of X.  This can also be disabled by
      setting an option in XF86Config (see README).

    * Fixed problem where OpenGL applications would sometimes leave
      portions of their rendering behind when the window was closed
      using the kill button on the window banner.

    * Fixed problem on mobile where X would respond to the wrong hotkey
      event under some conditions.

    * Fixed several more problems with indirect rendering.

    * Fixed problem on SMP machines which occured when VT switching
      while running gloss and gears indirect.

    * Fixed problem where /proc/nv/card0 did not report nv20 correctly.

    * Fixed problem on TNT2, where the driver would only support up to 4
      threads per process.

    * Fixed Xserver crash that occured when running two Xservers with
      AGPgart.

    * Fixed some problems in GLX that occured when running
      multi-threaded  applications.

2001-07-05 version 1.0-1420

      and restarting.

    * Fixed a problem on mobile platforms that prevented DVD's from
      displaying.

    * Fixed a problem that caused OpenGL programs to segfault when using
      a graphical login with xdm/kdm, and doing the following sequence:
      login, mode switch, logout, log in and run a GL app.

    * Fixed some indirect rendering problems.

    * Fixed a problem that caused Xconfigure to fail on NVIDIA drivers.

    * Fixed a crash that occured when X forwarding over SSH.

    * Fixed problem with make current to same drawable but different
      dpy.

    * Fixed problem in which OpenGL would segfault when reading X
      atoms.

    * X now gets the DPI (dots per inch) from the monitor's EDID (rather
      than just defaulting to 75 dpi).

    * All DPMS modes are now supported.  There are still issues on flat
      panels and on the second head of a TwinView system (please see the
      README).

    * Fixed support for AGP on systems with 1 GB or more of memory.

2001-02-16 version 0.9-769

    * Fixed problem where direct rendering applications were allowed to
      continue rendering after xkill was called.

    * Fixed problem where Tribes 2 crashed when compressed textures
      (s3tc textures) were used.

    * Some drawable leaks were fixed in X and GLX.

    * Fixed problem where the application would hang when calling
      glXMakeCurrent while holding the X server grab.

    * Bios-posting problems on GeForce2 GTS and GeForce Ultra cards were
      fixed.  This bug resulted in a significant performance loss.

    * Added support for the X Render extension.

    * TwinView functionality was enhanced so that each head can pan 
      independently.

    * Fixed problem on TNT and TNT2 where Xv(Shm)PutImage returned
      BadAlloc in high resolutions when there was not enough video
      bandwidth to display the YUV video overlay correctly. This works
      now but the resulting display has artifacts.

    * Fixed problem with cursor hanges in X.

    * Fixed problem with X console not restoring on some monitors.

    * Fixed problem with fork() and OpenGL rendering.

    * Fixed problem with X driver module, nvidia_drv.o, being stripped
      when RPM was rebuilt.

    * Added missing PCI device ids for some TNT2 variants and GeForce3.

    * Fixed problem where the kernel would often hang during X and/or
      OpenGL operation when on an SMP machine and using the 2.4 kernel.

    * Fixed SYNC_TO_VBLANK hang with 2.4 kernels.

    * DPMS is partially working again. It is possible to set the "off"
      option for dpms.  DPMS options "suspend" and "standby" are not
      fully supported -- they simply blank the screen.
